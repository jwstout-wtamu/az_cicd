      <h5>FSHD Local Chapters, September 6, 2022</h5>
	  
      <p>There is great power in community. Around the globe, individuals with FSHD are living proof of that. When we come together, each bringing our unique strengths to bear, we inspire each other to reach higher than we can when we go it alone. Follow the link below or use the form if you would like to get in contact with your local FSHD Chapter</p>
   <p> Invest in Hope:
   The  FSHD Society is a convener and collaborator to find solutions, but we canâ€™t do it alone. Your participation is vital to ending the suffering caused by FSH Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD). There are many ways you can get involved and play an active role.</p>
